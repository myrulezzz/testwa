How are Cablenet services installed?
Cablenet services are installed following delivery of service from the Cablenet network to the roof of your apartment building or house. Services will be connected and equipment installed at your home’s first TV installation outlet.
How are Cablenet services delivered to the subscriber premises?
All of Cablenet’s services (broadband service, TV and fixed telephony) are transmitted to the subscriber’s premises via coaxial or fibre-optic cable placed by Cablenet’s technical staff during installation. In the case of coaxial installation, the cable terminates at a special termination box (it’s called an isolator and splits the signal for the modem and TV services), or directly at the fibre-optic converter (usually the fibre-optic service modem) in the case of optical fibre cable installation.
Which are the RF frequencies that I can use for internal distribution within a home so as not to interfere with Cablenet’s signals?
To distribute RF frequencies within a home’s interior, kindly use only the frequencies below as all other frequencies are either used or may be used in the future for Cablenet’s own transmissions.

Channel 34 – Frequency 578 MHz
Channel 35 – Frequency 586 MHz
Channel 36 – Frequency 594 MHz

What are the DVB T broadcast frequencies on Cablenet’s network?
The best way to tune the DVB-T channels transmitted on Cablenet’s network is to use the automatic Digital Aerial (or similar) scanning feature of your TV set or receiver, if this is an available option.



If you want to manually tune the DVB-T channels, the frequency information is as follows:



Channel 31 – Frequency 554 MHz – Velister Transport Stream 2

What if Plume HomePass® service Advanced IoT Protection blocks a site that is actually safe?
When an anomaly is detected, the device will automatically be placed into quarantine to protect the integrity of your network and the devices connected to it. Quarantining the device effectively places “Internet Only” permission on the device, allowing basic functionality while preventing access to your other home devices. Advanced IoT Protection (AIP) uses machine learning on device network metadata to establish known behaviors. However, sometimes safe sites can be flagged as a false positive. If a new behavior comes across our large training samples or if device behaviors are updated by the vendor, the device may be incorrectly flagged. Learning happens continually to establish new normal behaviors, however can cause some alerts in the interim. If you trust the website the device is accessing, you can whitelist it for the device and for all devices in the home.When Should I Remove a Device From Quarantine?You should only remove a device from quarantine if you trust the website it was trying to access. On a quarantined device, there is a recommendation which will open a web search for the device’s manufacturer website, so you can do more research or find an updated firmware before removing the device from quarantine.Removing a Device from QuarantineOpen the device list and navigate to the Internet Only devices.Find the affected device. The affected device will be labeled: Device is quarantined.Tap on the quarantined device for more options.You can choose Unquarantine for 1 hour or Unquarantine permanently.

What is the Plume HomePass® service Sense™?
With Sense™ existing smart devices become motion detectors without the use of cameras, in order for you to gain whole-home awareness. The HomePass® app shows you movement in the vicinity of each connected device or room on your network.
Plume HomePass® service Sense Live View
Live View allows you to see both the location and intensity of the detected motion in real-time.In the Live View display, the overall intensity and duration of the motion are represented by the background wave. The devices detecting the motion are displayed to provide an approximate location of where the motion is being detected. Along with the motion intensity being detected by each device, this can be used to get an idea of where someone is moving. Be sure to assign rooms to your devices to better pinpoint where motion is happening.Accessing the Live ViewFrom the home screen, Scroll to the Sense section.The Live View will be available on the home screen. If you want to see more details tap on the Sense section.

How to choose your Motion Detection Devices using the Plume HomePass® service
How are devices chosen to detect motion?Sense uses a behind-the-scenes algorithm to pick from the Sense device list devices that are best suited for motion detection.Modifying the Sense device listThe pool of available devices (Sense device list) from which the algorithm chooses is based on all WiFi devices currently connected to a Pod, excluding mobile devices. This Sense device list can be modified by you to limit motion detection in certain areas. We recommend leaving all devices in the Sense Devices list selected for optimal performance, but if you would like to manually choose which devices can be used, the following guidelines will help you get the most coverage in your home.If you want to limit motion detection in certain areas of your home, deselect devices in those areas.Although Sense will keep most mobile devices separate, ensure you choose devices that will remain static.Avoid choosing devices that are battery operated or may frequently go into a low-power state. Always-on devices such as voice assistants and other smart home devices are good candidates.Since Pods are already being used to detect motion, avoid choosing devices that are either in the same room or very close to them.To better refine the motion sensitivity, use the Live View feature to test the motion detection in each room.How do I access and modify the Motion Detection Devices list?From the home screen, scroll down to the Sense section and tap on the Live view.Scroll down and tap on the pencil icon next to Sense devices.Remove the green checkmark next to any device you do not want to be used for motion detection or add a green checkmark next to devices you want to be used.Be sure to assign rooms to your devices if you haven’t already done so.The cloud will only use the 3 most appropriate devices connected to each Pod from your choices.

Why am I not receiving Plume HomePass® Sense notifications when there is motion in my home?
These are the most common reasons for not receiving Sense Alerts:Push notifications may have been disabled on your device.iOS – Enable push notificationsAndroid – Enable Push notificationsThe motion being detected is not enough to trigger a Sense alert. Alerts are triggered only if the motion event lasts at least 2 seconds (5 seconds with pet mode enabled) and within approximately 10-13 feet of a SuperPod or Sense enabled device.The sensitivity is set too low for the amount of motion present.Sense Alerts have been turned off.Unless Smart Activation is disabled, notifications will not be sent if you and your other family members are home.Why am I still receiving Plume HomePass® Sense motion notifications while I’m home?

Other than Smart Activation for Sense alerts not being enabled, the most common reason you may still be getting Sense alerts while you are home is that Primary devices have not been assigned to people or People profiles have not been created. Your Home / Away status is based on when all assigned primary devices have disconnected from the network. If you have not assigned any primary devices to people, your current status will always be away and notifications will always go out if there is motion.When Smart Activation has been enabled for Sense alerts, all Primary devices assigned to people must have disconnected from the network for at least 15 minutes. This also means that if someone leaves their primary device at home, alerts will not go out.Depending on your notification interval settings, not enough time has elapsed since your last alert.

I do not have an external antenna, but my house is connected to the Cablenet network. Do I need to install an external antenna to be able to watch the FTA Cypriot channels?
For coaxial cable connections, you don’t have to install an external antenna to watch Cypriot free-to-air channels if your premises are already connected to the Cablenet network. Digital signal in DVB–T format (terrestrial digital format) for Cypriot free-to-air channels, is also transmitted via the Cablenet network as it is transmitted by terrestrial digital service providers CyBC and Velister. It is therefore available in exactly the same way that you would have received it with an external antenna.



For optical fibre connections, you must install an outdoor antenna to receive Cypriot free-to-air channels.
Do I need a decoder in order to use your TV service?
The Purple TV channel package requires a Cablenet decoder.
Can I watch different channels on different TV sets at the same time?
The Purple TV digital TV service requires a decoder and can be accessed from up to three viewing points in your home (a decoder per point is required).
Can the Cablenet TV channels be distributed to several rooms in a home?
For coaxial cable connections, the RF signal transmitted by Cablenet in DVB-T format as mentioned above can be distributed to any number of viewing points via the home RF distribution network in exactly the same way as a conventional aerial RF signal received by an antenna. Where DVB-C encrypted TV services are concerned, they can be installed at up to three points within the home via the home RF distribution network and the use of a Cablenet decoder. Depending on the number of terminals and the quality of the coaxial cabling of the home RF distribution network, the RF signal may need to be boosted.



For optical fibre connections, rather than connecting the decoder via WiFi, networking and the use of ethernet cable within the home is recommended for optimal speed and the prevention of interference by neighbouring WiFi networks, low connection speed due to increased use of the WiFi network by other devices within the home, or weak WiFi signal due to the layout of the home’s interior.



If you need any related assistance, kindly consult a network installation specialist. Please note that the Amino decoder can be installed at up to three points within the home.
Are there subtitles for the international channels?
Greek subtitles or dubbing are offered on the following subtitles:



Movies Best, FOX, FoxLife, Cablenet Cinema, Novacinema 1-4, National Geographic HD, Discovery Channel, National Geographic, Nat Geo Wild HD, Animal Planet, Discovery Science, BBC Earth HD, History HD, ID, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Boomerang HD, Baby TV, E! Entertainment, TLC, Motorvision HD, Edge Sport HD, Novasports Prime, Novasports 2-5, Novasports Start, Euronews GR.
How are TV channels transmitted to end users over the Cablenet network?
For optical fibre connections, the Amino decoder may be connected to the fibre-optic converter (usually the fibre-optic service modem) using an ethernet cable or alternatively use the ethernet connection within the home if that is provided. The Amino decoder supports WiFi connection, however ethernet connection is recommended for optimal connection quality, as well as optimal picture and sound quality. For further related information, please see the section below for advanced users.
What types of TV channel signals are transmitted over the Cablenet network?
The following types of TV channels are included in the RF signal transmitted via the Cablenet network (further information for advanced users is also available in the following section):a) DVB‑C (Digital Video Broadcast Cable)All of Cablenet’s TV channels are transmitted in this format for coaxial cable connections. Cypriot free-to-air channels are transmitted unencrypted while subscription channels are encrypted.b) DVB‑T (Digital Video Broadcast Terrestrial)Cypriot free-to-air channels are transmitted unencrypted in this format in exactly the same way that they are aerially transmitted by terrestrial digital TV service providers CyBC and Velister for coaxial cable connections.c) IPAll channels are transmitted in IP format to customers with an optical fibre connection, with the exception of certain areas with fibre-optic connection and simultaneous RF transmission via fibre-optic cable.



Cypriot free-to-air channels are transmitted unencrypted in this format.
a) DVB‑C (Digital Video Broadcast Cable)
b) DVB‑T (Digital Video Broadcast Terrestrial)
c) IP
How are the Cablenet interactive TV services transmitted?
Interactive TV services are transmitted via IP, the same protocol through which internet services are provided. To activate interactive services such as Replay TV (Catch-up TV) and Video on Demand (VOD), Cablenet’s Arion decoder must be connected to the Cablenet modem using a suitable ethernet cable. If the decoder is located near the modem, this is usually done by Cablenet’s technical staff during installation. Additionally, Cablenet’s Arion decoder must set to hybrid VOD Mode fromthe menu (Settings‑>System Mode) in order to activate interactive services.



The Amino decoder needs a permanent internet connection for channels and interactive services to function, even if channels are received via coaxial cable.
How is the Cablenet Set Top Box (STB) connected to the TV?
To benefit from better transmission quality of the TV channels provided by Cablenet, such as picture quality in High Definition (HD) and digital sound, Cablenet’s decoder must be connected to the TV set using the HDMI cable provided. If this is not possible, a special RCA cable (which can be found at Cablenet stores) can then be used, however picture quality for HD channels will not be optimal. In addition, the Amino decoder will have to be connected to the modem via either ethernet or WiFi. It is recommended that the decoder is connected via ethernet cable rather than WiFi, for optimal quality and the prevention of interference by neighbouring WiFi networks, low connection speed due to increased use of the WiFi network by other devices within the home, or weak WiFi signal due to the layout of the home’s interior.
How many STBs can I have under the same Cablenet TV subscription?
Up to three decoders may be used per subscription in order to receive encrypted TV services such as Purple TV. These decoders may also be used for Cablenet interactive services, as long as each one is directly connected to the Cablenet modem using an ethernet cable. In the case of 24-month contracts for Cablenet packages that include TV services, the first decoder is provided free of charge. In all other cases, as well as for second or third points, decoders are provided with a monthly charge of €5 per decoder.



For Purple TV Stream and Purple Sports Stream, the equipment cost is €90/decoder.
Can I watch the FTA Cypriot channels in parallel to watching on a Cablenet STB?
For coaxial cable connections, regardless of the number of Cablenet decoders used within a home under a single subscription, any other devices, such as TV sets or DVB-C or DVB-T receivers, can be used simultaneously to receive Cypriot free-to-air channels which are transmitted clearly by the Cablenet network. The only requirement is that distribution of the RF signal within the home is done correctly and that receiving devices are directly connected to RF distribution network via the RF-in port. Kindly consult a TV system installation specialist if you need assistance to do so.



For optical fibre connections, you must install an external antenna to receive Cypriot free-to-air channels provided by terrestrial digital service providers such as CyBC and Velister. Kindly consult a TV system installation specialist if you need assistance to do so.
On which connector are Cablenet TV channels provided?
For coaxial cable connections, the RF signal transmitted by Cablenet, including all types of TV channel transmissions, is provided at a designated connector (with a screw-on threaded port called a female F‑type connector) on the isolator or the fibre converter for coaxial or optical fibre installations, respectively. Connection of the Cablenet decoder is done by Cablenet’s technical staff during installation, using a suitable coaxial cable (which is terminated with a male F‑type connector at one end). If connection to additional TV sets or the home RF distribution network is required, this can be done by a TV systems installation specialist or by the user themself if they are familiar with the required procedure, equipment and cables.



N.B.: The internet connection signal via Cablenet’s coaxial network is delivered to a separate designated female F‑type connector on the isolator. Consequently, it is recommended that only authorised Cablenet technical staff or TV system installation specialists connect or disconnect cables from the isolator to avoid the risk of damaging the network or equipment.



For optical fibre connections, channels are transmitted via ethernet cable connecting one of the available ethernet ports of the fibre-optic converter (usually the fibre-optic service modem) to the decoder’s ethernet port.
What is DVB C and what channels are provided through this transmission method on Cablenet’s network?
DVB-C stands for Digital Video Broadcast Cable and is the primary method for transmitting TV channels used by the Cablenet network as it is optimised for coaxial cable networks. All of Cablenet’s TV channels are transmitted in this format. Cypriot free-to-air channels are transmitted in an unencrypted format, while all other channels included in Cablenet’s TV packages are encrypted. For all information regarding Cablenet’s channels and TV packages, visithttps://cablenet.com.cy/en/channels/A Cablenet decoder is required to view Cablenet’s encrypted TV services and it is also used to view Cypriot free-to-air channels. Other devices capable of receiving DVB-C, such as TV sets with DVB-C (Digital Cable) tuners can be used to watch unencrypted free-to-air channels.
What is DVB T and what channels are provided through this transmission method on Cablenet’s network?
DVB-T stands for Digital Video Broadcast Terrestrial and is the method for transmitting TV channels usually used for terrestrial digital transmission, as done in Cyprus by CyBC and Velister. When transmitted aerially, DVB-T signals are usually received by a common domestic antenna. Cablenet retransmits all DVB-T channels on its cable network in exactly the same way as they are transmitted by CyBC and Velister. Consequently, every premises connected to Cablenet’s coaxial network, regardless of whether it is subscribed to Cablenet’s services or not, can receive Cypriot free-to-air channels without the need for an external antenna. All channels transmitted by CyBC and Velister can be received via DVB-T on the Cablenet network.



Any devices capable of receiving DVB-T, such as TV sets with DVB-T (Digital Aerial) tuners or suitable DVB-T receivers, can be used to watch free-to-air channels.
What are the DVB-C broadcast frequencies on Cablenet’s network?
If you aren’t using a Cablenet decoder, the best way to tune DVB-C channels transmitted on Cablenet’s network is to use your TV set’s automatic digital cable scanning feature (or similar), if this is an option.



For manual tuning, Cablenet DVB-C channels are broadcast between frequencies 610 MHz to 746 MHz. The tuning parameters are as follows:



Modulation: QAM256



Symbol Rate: 6950



Network ID: 1



If a network tuning mode or option is available, it can be selected to speed up tuning.



N.B.: Cablenet reserves the right to change the transmission frequencies and parameters of its DVB-C channel broadcast at its discretion at any time.
